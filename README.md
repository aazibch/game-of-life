# Game of Life

## Conway's Game of Life

The Game of Life, also known simply as Life, is a cellular automaton devised by the British mathematician John Horton Conway in 1970.

The game is a zero-player game, meaning that its evolution is determined by its initial state, requiring no further input. One interacts with the Game of Life by creating an initial configuration and observing how it evolves, or, for advanced players, by creating patterns with particular properties.

## The Application

This simulation of the Game of Life allows users to add or remove live cells by selecting them on the grid.

## Running the Application

In order to run the app, install the required dependencies by running the following command:

```
npm install
```

Then run the following to run the development server:

```
npm start
```
